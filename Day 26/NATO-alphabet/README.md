## Description

according to wikipedia The International Radiotelephone Spelling Alphabet, commonly known as the NATO phonetic alphabet,
NATO spelling alphabet, ICAO phonetic alphabet or ICAO spelling alphabet, is the most widely used radiotelephone
spelling alphabet. The ITU phonetic alphabet and figure code is a rarely used variant that differs in the code words for
digits.

To create the code, a series of international agencies assigned 26 code words acrophonically to the letters of the
English alphabet, so that the names for letters and numbers would be distinct enough to be easily understood by those
who exchanged voice messages by radio or telephone, regardless of language differences or the quality of the connection.
The specific code words varied, as some seemingly distinct words were found to be ineffective in real-life conditions.
In 1956, NATO modified the then-current set of code words used by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO);
this modification then became the international standard when it was accepted by the ICAO that year and by the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) a few years later.[1] The words were chosen to be accessible to speakers of
French and Spanish in addition to English; the spellings of a couple of code words were changed to facilitate their use.
