## Caeser Cipher 
According to wikipedia a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

<b>Steps of creating the caeser cipher</b>
### step one 
* Create a function called 'encrypt' that takes the 'text' and 'shift' as inputs.
* Inside the 'encrypt' function, shift each letter of the 'text' forwards in the alphabet by the shift amount and print the encrypted text.  
* Call the encrypt function and pass in the user inputs. You should be able to test the code and encrypt a message.
